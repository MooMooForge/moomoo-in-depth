# Explaining the packets

## Mouse / Space attack
This packet is sent on mouse down / mouse up. (space down / space up). Setting the first item to 1 starts the hit, setting it to 0 stops it. (so 1 at mousedown, 0 at mouseup). The second item is the angle of the mouse.

formula: `Math.atan2(mouseY - (screenHeight / 2), mouseX - (screenWidth / 2));`

### Auto Attack / Lock Dir

This packet is being sent when you press E / X.

setting the first item to 1 sends the auto attack, setting it to 0 sends the lock dir.
sending the same packet again will stop the effect.

### Send Chat

sends a chat message, first message is a string containing the chat message.

### Clan Accept player

sends the clan accept packet, first item is the playerSID.

### create clan

sends the create clan packet, first item is the clan name.

### Clan Kick player

sends the clan kick packet, first item is the playerSID.

### Clan send join Request

sends the clan join request packet, first item is the clan name.

### hat/acc_buy / equip

sent when you click the hat or accessory button.

first item is 0 when you want to equip a hat / accessory, 1 when you want to buy a hat / accessory. second item is the hat / accessory ID. third item is 0 when its a hat, 1 when its an accessory.

### clan Leave
sent when you want to leave a clan

### ping packet
when this packet is sent, the server will respond with a ping packet. its used to measure the ping.

### hold item
sent when you want to hold an item. first item is the item ID.

### select Upgrade
sent when you want to select an upgrade. first item is the item ID.

### set angle

sent when you want to set the angle. first item is the angle.

formula: `Math.atan2(mouseY - (screenHeight / 2), mouseX - (screenWidth / 2));`

### Spawn Player

send when you want to spawn.

first item is the name, second is the moofoll, third is the skin.

Moofoll is a boolean, true when you want 100+ resources when you spawm, false when you want 0 resources.

### window focus

sent when the window is focused. no args.

### send movement

sent when a user presses a key. In the default moomoo.io bundle, the packet is being used with a few configuration keys:

```js
var moveKeys = {
    87: [0, -1],
    38: [0, -1],
    83: [0, 1],
    40: [0, 1],
    65: [-1, 0],
    37: [-1, 0],
    68: [1, 0],
    39: [1, 0]
};
```

each key has a different specification about where the player needs to move.

Though, the packet also accepts angles in radians.

For example, when I have another player's x and y coordinates, and i want to for example move into the direction of that enemy, it would look something like this:

```js
let angle = Math.atan2(enemy.y-myPlayer.y, enemy.x-myPlayer.x);
// then pass the angle as an argument into the packet
```

### pingMap
sent when the user presses the key R. The only arg is 1.
